# PacMen
## _Factory for making pacmen using JavaScript and HTML code_
When the "Add PacMan" button is pressed, a new PacMan is placed on the screen at random coordinates. This can be done an unlimited number of times. 
Then, press the "Start Game" button to cause each added PacMan to move at random velocities, bouncing off the walls of the screen.
